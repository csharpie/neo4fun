# Neo4j and Py2Neo Tutorials

I want to use this repository to demonstrate how to use both Neo4j and Py2Neo. The blog of Max De Marzi has some great tutorials written for Ruby and I hope to convert those samples to Python using the Py2Neo driver.

The friends.py file is derivative of this tutorial. http://maxdemarzi.com/2012/01/04/getting-started-with-ruby-and-neo4j/
